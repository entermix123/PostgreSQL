1. Count Employees by Town

Create a function fn_count_employees_by_town(town_name) that accepts town_name VARCHAR(20) as a parameter and returns the count of employees living there.

Example
The following example is for employees living in "Sofia".
count
3


2. Employees Promotion

Create a stored procedure sp_increase_salaries(department_name) to increase the salary of all employees working at a given department (provided as a parameter). Increase salaries by 5%.

Example
The following example is given with employees in the "Finance" department ordered by first_name, then by salary.
first_name salary
Barbara 27720.0000
Bryan 19950.0000
Candy 19950.0000
… …


3. Employees Promotion by ID

Create a stored procedure(transaction) sp_increase_salary_by_id(id) that increases a given employee's salary (by id as a parameter) by 5%. Consider that you cannot promote an employee who doesn't exist – if that happens, no changes to the database shall be made.

Example
The following example is given with employee_id = 17.
salary
14175.0000


4. Triggered

Create a table deleted_employees(employee_id PK, first_name, last_name, middle_name, job_title, deparment_id, salary) that will hold information about fired (deleted) employees from the employees table. Add a trigger to the employees table that inserts the corresponding information into deleted_employees table.
▪ deleted_employees table:
o employee_id – primary key
o first_name - max-length 20
o last_name - max-length 20
o middle_name - max-length 20
o job_title – max-length 50
o department_id – integer
o salary – numeric (19,4)
